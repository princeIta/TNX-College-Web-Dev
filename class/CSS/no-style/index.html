            <h1>CSS</h1>
            <p>
                The "C" in CSS stands for cascading.
                Styles are said to cascade because they
                follow a specific hierarchy. We learned above three
                different ways to apply styles, but what if you tried
                to style the same element in each of three different ways?
            </p>

            <p>
                The hierarchy that the browser will follow is external, internal, then inline. Technically speaking, all
                of
                the styles will apply, but only the inline styles will win in the end. There is one exception, however,
                and
                that is when you use the important rule.

            <h1>The Important Rule</h1>
            <p>
                The important rule is an exception that you can apply to your styles that tells the browser "make this
                CSS
                rule apply, no matter what". It is generally frown upon to be used unless absolutely necessary because
                it
                violates the cascading nature of CSS.
