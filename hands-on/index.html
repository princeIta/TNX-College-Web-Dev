		Shouldn't <a href="http://google.com">SoftwareDevelopment</a> be more like engineering? Or is this a case of
		DisciplineEnvy. Many CS (that "S" is for "Science", as in ComputerScience, another envy) departments have been
		moved into engineering schools, though that may simply be a tactic to grab industry dollars.
		<br> Hello &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; World

	Theses steps have lead to engineering discipline...

		<li><a href="http:/google.com">Software Process</a></li>
		<li><a href="http:google.com">Software Metrics</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://google.com">Software handbook</a></li>

				Have they, though? Most of the process we have in the software world doesn't work very well (and are
				rarely applied anyway), very few development shops use metrics, the contents of our "handbooks" tend to
				be highly domain specific and are always out of date.
				Check out DavidParnas's claim that "[...]new methods in [Electrical] Engineering were not adopted as a
				result of the kind of things we are trying in Software Engineering. Engineers use methods if they work.
				[...] It wasn't necessary for Gauss or Kirchoff to form "User Groups" or write "Ten Commandments" style
				articles to sell their ideas. The ideas sold themselves. [...] We are putting too much effort into
				selling methods that are not yet ready. If they were ready, we would not have to sell them."

			Software engineering is just like software development, except with the following difference: imagine
			signing the paper below and giving it to your employer:
			I, __________, do hereby pledge that the project I am running
			works for the requirements described by my employer.
			If it does not work, I accept full personal, financial,
			and criminal responsibility.

		That's it. Engineering isn't about design, or architecture, or abstraction, or algorithms, or fiddling with
		bits. It's about a personal guarantee. Canadian engineering societies weren't formed because people wanted
		"higher standards of practice" - they were formed because a bridge in Quebec fell down three times, killing many
		people, and nobody was responsible. Engineering is sucking it up and saying "I'm responsible". Not the compiler
		vendor, not Microsoft, not your boss, and not your subordinates. Your job is to make sure that everything you
		use is safe - if Microsoft's module isn't safe, you don't use it. If your employee's code isn't safe, you don't
		use it. "I didn't know" isn't an excuse. It was your job to know. If your bosses have ordered you to do
		something that isn't safe - you don't sign off on it. You argue until they either give in or fire you, and if
		they fire you then you take them to court and prove that they fired you because they wanted you to sign off on
		something unsafe for their customers, employees, or public.
		This means that nobody wants an engineer, or to be an engineer, without a good reason. Engineers are needed
		where it is _necessary_ - not because it's a neat idea. An engineer is perfectly capable of working in software
		development, but it isn't engineering until he gives his personal guarantee - otherwise, he's just an engineer
		working as a software developer.
		All the other stuff about standards of practice, conventions, etc. come as a product of this first
		accountability - not the other way around.
